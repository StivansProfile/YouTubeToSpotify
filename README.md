# YouTube to Spotify
I recently went through some YouTube playlists I had from years ago and I found out that some of these playlists were fire.
<br>
I wanted to transfer them into my Spotify but some of them
had more than a 100 songs.
<br>
<br>
*That's why I wrote a simple script that can transfer any public YouTube playlist's songs into my Spotify account.*
<hr>

## What is it and what does it do ?
So that is what "YouTube to Spotify is. A simple script that allows you to:
<br>
1. Add the songs from any public YouTube playlist into your Spotify
2. Give your new Spotify playlist a name and a description
3. Complete that process relatively fast üòÅ

## How does it work ?
1. Enter a playlist ID, a name and a description for your playlist

2. You get a playlist ID by opening the playlist and taking the ID after the list parameter in the URL

3. The script will then look for these songs in Spotify

4. Open your Spotify after the script is done transfering the songs

## How do I use it ?
You can find the .exe file of the script in the /dist directory and use it from there.

You can also clone the repo and use it that way.
